# First-Desktop-Software

### Nothing fancy here just a basic program. My first attempt to software development. 
#### Steps to run the code to work successfully 

- Connect internet connection ( This is very important or it will not work as expected )
- Run the code, it will create a folder with a database file. The database contains files the program will need to work.
 
The program will download all the files it needs and saves it into the database. 
The download is only done once.
